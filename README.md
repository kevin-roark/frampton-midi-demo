# Frampton MIDI Demo

To use:
1. Create a midi song with up to 9 tracks (songs with slightly longish notes, or notes with a bit of space between them, will work best) and save that file as "song.mid" in this folder
2. Choose a video you would like to represent for each track, and place that video into the videos folder here with the name "1.mp4" for the first track, "2.mp4" for the second track, and so on
3. Enter "./build.sh" into the terminal to create the output, and then open the link http://localhost:3000 when the program tells you to!

love ya thanks
